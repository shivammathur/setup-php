**Note:** Specifying `8.0` in `php-version` input installs a nightly build of `PHP 8.0.0-dev` with `PHP JIT`, `Union Types v2` and other [new features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc#php_80 "New features implemented in PHP 8"). See [nightly build setup](#nightly-build-setup) for more information.

## :cloud: OS/Platform Support

Both `GitHub-hosted` runners and `self-hosted` runners are supported on the following operating systems.

### GitHub-Hosted Runners

|Virtual environment|YAML workflow label|Pre-installed PHP|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Ubuntu 16.04|`ubuntu-16.04`|`PHP 5.6` to `PHP 7.4`|
|Ubuntu 18.04|`ubuntu-latest` or `ubuntu-18.04`|`PHP 7.1` to `PHP 7.4`|
|Ubuntu 20.04|`ubuntu-20.04`|`PHP 7.4`|

|macOS Catalina 10.15|`macos-latest` or `macos-10.15`|`PHP 7.4`|

### Self-Hosted Runners

|Host OS/Virtual environment|YAML workflow label|
|--- |--- |
|Ubuntu 16.04|`self-hosted` or `Linux`|
|Ubuntu 18.04|`self-hosted` or `Linux`|
|Ubuntu 20.04|`self-hosted` or `Linux`|

|Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer|`self-hosted` or `Windows`|
|macOS Catalina 10.15|`self-hosted` or `macOS`|

- Refer to the [self-hosted setup](#self-hosted-setup) to use the action on self-hosted runners.

## :heavy_plus_sign: PHP Extension Support

- On `ubuntu` by default extensions which are available as a package can be installed. PECL extensions if not available as a package can be installed by specifying `pecl` in the tools input.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  tools: pecl
  extensions: swoole
```

- On `windows` PECL extensions which have the `DLL` binary can be installed.

- On `macOS` PECL extensions can be installed.

- Extensions installed along with PHP if specified are enabled.

- Specific versions of PECL extensions can be installed by suffixing the version. This is useful for installing old versions of extensions which support end of life PHP versions.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '5.4'
  tools: pecl
  extensions: swoole-1.9.3
```

- Pre-release versions of PECL extensions can be setup by suffixing the extension with its state i.e `alpha`, `beta`, `devel` or `snapshot`.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  tools: pecl
  extensions: xdebug-beta
```

- Non-default extensions can be removed by prefixing it with a `:`.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'  
  extensions: :opcache
```

- Extensions which cannot be added or removed gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the action is not interrupted.

- These extensions have custom support - `gearman` on ubuntu, `blackfire`, `phalcon3` and `phalcon4` on all supported OS.

## :wrench: Tools Support

These tools can be setup globally using the `tools` input.

`blackfire`, `blackfire-player`, `codeception`, `composer`, `composer-prefetcher`, `cs2pr`, `deployer`, `flex`, `infection`, `pecl`, `phan`, `phinx`, `phive`, `phpcbf`, `phpcpd`, `php-config`, `php-cs-fixer`, `phpcs`, `phpize`, `phpmd`, `phpstan`, `phpunit`, `prestissimo`, `psalm`, `symfony`, `vapor-cli`

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit
```

To setup a particular version of a tool, specify it in the form `tool:version`.  
Latest stable version of `composer` is setup by default. You can setup the required version by specifying `v1`, `v2`, `snapshot` or `preview` as version.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  tools: composer:v2
```

Version for other tools should be in `semver` format and a valid release of the tool.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  tools: php-cs-fixer:2.16.2, phpunit:8.5.1
```

**Notes**
- Both agent `blackfire-agent` and client `blackfire` are setup when `blackfire` is specified.
- Tools which cannot be setup gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the action is not interrupted.

## :signal_strength: Coverage Support

### Xdebug

Specify `coverage: xdebug` to use `Xdebug`.  
Runs on all [PHP versions supported](#tada-php-support "List of PHP versions supported on this GitHub Action").

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  coverage: xdebug
```

### PCOV

Specify `coverage: pcov` to use `PCOV` and disable `Xdebug`.  
`PCOV` supports `PHP 7.1` and newer PHP versions.  
Tests with `PCOV` run much faster than with `Xdebug`.  
If your source code directory is other than `src`, `lib` or, `app`, specify `pcov.directory` using the `ini-values` input.  

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  ini-values: pcov.directory=api #optional, see above for usage.
  coverage: pcov
```

### Disable Coverage

Specify `coverage: none` to remove both `Xdebug` and `PCOV`.  
Consider disabling the coverage using this PHP action for these reasons.

- You are not generating coverage reports while testing.
- It will remove `Xdebug`, which will have a positive impact on PHP performance.
- You are using `phpdbg` for running your tests.
- You are profiling your code using `blackfire`.

```yaml
uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
with:
  php-version: '7.4'
  coverage: none
```

### Basic Setup

> Setup a particular PHP version.

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '7.4'
    extensions: mbstring, intl
    ini-values: post_max_size=256M, short_open_tag=On
    coverage: xdebug    
    tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit
```

### Matrix Setup

> Setup multiple PHP versions on multiple operating systems.

```yaml
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.operating-system }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        operating-system: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        php-versions: ['5.6', '7.0', '7.1', '7.2', '7.3', '7.4']
    name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }} Test on ${{ matrix.operating-system }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
        extensions: mbstring, intl
        ini-values: post_max_size=256M, short_open_tag=On
        coverage: xdebug        
        tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit
```

### Nightly Build Setup

> Setup a nightly build of `PHP 8.0.0-dev` from the [master branch](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/master "Master branch on PHP source repository") of PHP.

- This version is currently in development.
- `PECL` is installed by default with this version on `ubuntu` and `macOS`.
- Some extensions might not support this version currently.
- Refer to this [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit "PHP JIT RFC configuration") for configuring `PHP JIT` on this version.
- Refer to this [list of RFCs](https://wiki.php.net/rfc#php_80 "List of RFCs implemented in PHP8") implemented in this version.

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '8.0'
    extensions: mbstring
    ini-values: opcache.jit_buffer_size=256M, opcache.jit=1235, pcre.jit=1
    coverage: pcov
    tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit
```

### Self Hosted Setup

> Setup PHP on a self-hosted runner.

- To setup a dockerized self-hosted runner, refer to this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Ubuntu) to setup in an `Ubuntu` container and refer to this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Windows) to setup in a `Windows` container.
- To setup the runner directly on the host OS or in a VM, follow this [requirements guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Requirements-for-self-hosted-runners "Requirements guide for self-hosted runner to run setup-php") before setting up the self-hosted runner.

Specify the environment variable `runner` with the value `self-hosted`. Without this your workflow will fail.

```yaml
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    strategy:
      matrix:        
        php-versions: ['5.6', '7.0', '7.1', '7.2', '7.3', '7.4', '8.0']
    name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
      env:
        runner: self-hosted # Specify the runner.
```

### Local Testing Setup

> Test your `Ubuntu` workflow locally using [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act "Project to test GitHub Actions locally").

```yaml
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: PHP 7.4 Test
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: 7.4
```

Run the workflow locally with `act` using [`shivammathur/node`](https://github.com/shivammathur/node-docker "Docker image to run setup-php") docker image.

```bash
# For runs-on: ubuntu-latest
act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest

# For runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
act -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:focal

# For runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
act -P ubuntu-18.04=shivammathur/node:bionic

# For runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
act -P ubuntu-16.04=shivammathur/node:xenial
```

### Thread Safe Setup

> Setup both `TS` and `NTS` PHP on `Windows`.

- `NTS` versions are setup by default.
- On `Ubuntu` and `macOS` only `NTS` versions are supported.
- On `Windows` both `TS` and `NTS` versions are supported.

```yaml
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    name: Setup PHP TS on Windows
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '7.4'
      env:
        phpts: ts # specify ts or nts
```

### Force Update

> Update to latest patch of PHP versions.

- Pre-installed PHP versions on the GitHub Actions runner are not updated to their latest patch release by default.
- You can specify the `update` environment variable to `true` to force update to the latest release.

```yaml
- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '7.4'
  env:
    update: true # specify true or false
```

### Verbose Setup

> Debug your workflow

To debug any issues, you can use the `verbose` tag instead of `v2`.

```yaml
- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@verbose
  with:
    php-version: '7.4'
```

### Cache Extensions

You can cache PHP extensions using [`shivammathur/cache-extensions`](https://github.com/shivammathur/cache-extensions "GitHub Action to cache php extensions") and [`action/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache "GitHub Action to cache files") GitHub Actions. Extensions which take very long to setup when cached are available in the next workflow run and are enabled directly. This reduces the workflow execution time.

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ matrix.operating-system }}
strategy:
  matrix:
    operating-system: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    php-versions: ['7.2', '7.3', '7.4']
name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }} Test on ${{ matrix.operating-system }}
env:
  extensions: intl, pcov
  key: cache-v1 # can be any string, change to clear the extension cache.
steps:
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Setup cache environment
  id: cache-env
  uses: shivammathur/cache-extensions@v1
  with:
    php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
    extensions: ${{ env.extensions }}
    key: ${{ env.key }}

- name: Cache extensions
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ${{ steps.cache-env.outputs.dir }}
    key: ${{ steps.cache-env.outputs.key }}
    restore-keys: ${{ steps.cache-env.outputs.key }}

- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
    extensions: ${{ env.extensions }}
```

**Note:** If you setup both `TS` and `NTS` PHP versions on `windows`, add `${{ env.phpts }}` to `key` and `restore-keys` inputs in `actions/cache` step.

### Cache Composer Dependencies

If your project uses composer, you can persist composer's internal cache directory. Dependencies cached are loaded directly instead of downloading them while installation. The files cached are available across check-runs and will reduce the workflow execution time.

```yaml
- name: Get composer cache directory
  id: composer-cache
  run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(composer config cache-files-dir)"

- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ${{ steps.composer-cache.outputs.dir }}
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.lock') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-

- name: Install dependencies
  run: composer install --prefer-dist
```

**Notes**
- Please do not cache `vendor` directory using `action/cache` as that will have side-effects.
- In the above example, if you support a range of `composer` dependencies and do not commit `composer.lock`, you can use the hash of `composer.json` as the key for your cache.

```yaml
key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.json') }}
```

### Cache Node.js Dependencies

If your project has node.js dependencies, you can persist npm's or yarn's cache directory. The cached files are available across check-runs and will reduce the workflow execution time.

```yaml
- name: Get node.js cache directory
  id: node-cache-dir
  run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(npm config get cache)" # Use $(yarn cache dir) for yarn

- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ${{ steps.node-cache-dir.outputs.dir }}
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }} # Use '**/yarn.lock' for yarn
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

**Note:** Please do not cache `node_modules` directory as that will have side-effects.

### Composer GitHub OAuth

If you have a number of workflows which setup multiple tools or have many composer dependencies, you might hit the GitHub's rate limit for composer. To avoid that you can add a `OAuth` token to the composer's config by setting `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable. You can use [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token "GITHUB_TOKEN documentation") secret for this purpose.

```yaml
- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '7.4'
  env:
    COMPOSER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Problem Matchers

#### PHP

Setup problem matchers for your `PHP` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step. This will scan the logs for PHP errors and warnings, and surface them prominently in the GitHub Actions UI by creating annotations and log file decorations.

```yaml
- name: Setup problem matchers for PHP
  run: echo "::add-matcher::${{ runner.tool_cache }}/php.json"
```

#### PHPUnit

Setup problem matchers for your `PHPUnit` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step. This will scan the logs for failing tests and surface that information prominently in the GitHub Actions UI by creating annotations and log file decorations.

```yaml
- name: Setup problem matchers for PHPUnit
  run: echo "::add-matcher::${{ runner.tool_cache }}/phpunit.json"
```

#### Other Tools

For tools that support `checkstyle` reporting like `phpstan`, `psalm`, `php-cs-fixer` and `phpcs` you can use `cs2pr` to annotate your code.  
For examples refer to [cs2pr documentation](https://github.com/staabm/annotate-pull-request-from-checkstyle).  

> Here is an example with `phpstan`.

```yaml
- name: Setup PHP
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '7.4'
    tools: cs2pr, phpstan

- name: PHPStan
  run: phpstan analyse src --error-format=checkstyle | cs2pr
```
